            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> 2026  Messiah Foundation International  In accordance with the predictions in Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi's book The Religion of God, this spiritual organisation believes that the world will end when an asteroid collides with Earth in 2026. </div></li>
          
            <li>
            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> 2060  Isaac Newton (attrib.)  In an unpublished manuscript, Newton made a reference to the year 2060, which in 2004 was falsely reported by mainstream media as a date for the end of the world. Newton was actually predicting a date before which the world would definitely not end, in order to calm people's fears about the apocalypse. </div></li>
          
            <li>
            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> 2129  Said Nursi  According to this Sunni Muslim theologian, the world will end in 2129. </div></li>
          
            <li>
            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> 2239  Talmud, Orthodox Judaism  According to an opinion about the Talmud in mainstream Orthodox Judaism, the Messiah will come within 6,000 years of the creation of Adam, and the world may be destroyed 1,000 years later. This would put the beginning of the period of desolation in 2239 CE and the end of the period of desolation in 3239 CE. </div></li>
          
            <li>
            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> 2280  Rashad Khalifa  According to this Egyptian-American biochemist's research on the Quran, the world will end in 2280. </div></li>

            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> 300000  Peter Tuthill  In approximately 300,000 years, WR 104, a triple star, is expected to explode in a supernova. It has been suggested that it may produce a gamma ray burst that could pose a threat to life on Earth should its poles be aligned 12° or lower towards Earth. However spectroscopic observations now strongly suggest that it is tilted at an angle of 30°-40° and so any gamma ray burst should not hit Earth. </div></li>
          
            <li>
            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> < 500,000  Nick Bostrom  According to a journal article by Bostrom, an asteroid impacting with Earth would need to be larger than 1 km in diameter to render humans extinct. It is estimated that such an asteroid hits Earth about every 500,000 years. </div></li>
          
            <li>
            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> < 1 million  The Geological Society  Within the next 1 million years, Earth will likely have undergone a supervolcanic eruption large enough to erupt 3,200 km3 of magma, an event comparable to the Toba supereruption 75,000 years ago. </div></li>
          
            <li>
            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> 16 million  Various  A hypothetical dark companion star, Nemesis, with an eccentric orbit of about 27 million years, triggers periodic mass extinctions by perturbing objects beyond Neptune into hitting the Earth. The K–Pg extinction which killed dinosaurs 66 million years ago is used as an anchor point in time for the cycle. Arguments against say it is a statistical artifact and sky surveys have failed to find it. </div></li>
          
            <li>
            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> < 100 million  Stephen A. Nelson  It is estimated that every 100 million years, Earth will be hit by an asteroid about 10–15 km in diameter, comparable in size to the one that triggered the K–Pg extinction which killed dinosaurs 66 million years ago. </div></li>
          
            <li>
            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> 500–600 million  Anne Minard  By this time it is estimated that a gamma ray burst, or massive, hyperenergetic supernova, would have occurred within 6,500 light-years of Earth; close enough for its rays to affect Earth's ozone layer and potentially trigger a mass extinction, assuming the hypothesis is correct that a previous such explosion triggered the Ordovician–Silurian extinction event. However, the supernova would have to be precisely oriented relative to Earth to have any negative effect. </div></li>
          
            <li>
            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> 600–800 million  Various  By this time the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will have dropped below the level required for C3 carbon fixation in plants. The resulting lack of oxygen-producing plants will cause free oxygen in the atmosphere to disappear, making aerobic life impossible. </div></li>
          
            <li>
            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> 1–5 billion  Various  The estimated end of the Sun's current phase of development, after which it will swell into a red giant, either scorching or swallowing Earth, will occur around five billion years from now. However, as the Sun grows gradually hotter (over millions of years), Earth may become too hot for life as early as one billion years from now. </div></li>
          
            <li>
            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> 1.3 billion  Various  It is estimated that all eukaryotic life will die out due to carbon dioxide starvation. Only prokaryotes will remain. </div></li>
          
            <li>
            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> 7.59 billion  David Powell  Earth and the Moon will be most likely be destroyed by being engulfed by the Sun, just before it reaches the largest of its red giant phase when it will be 256 times larger than it is now. Before the final collision, the Moon possibly spirals below Earth's Roche limit, breaking into a ring of debris, most of which falls to Earth's surface. </div></li>
          
            <li>
            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> 22 billion  Various  The end of the Universe in the Big Rip scenario, assuming a model of dark energy with w = −1.5. Observations of galaxy cluster speeds by the Chandra X-ray Observatory suggest that the true value of w is ~-0.991, meaning the Big Rip will not occur. </div></li>
          
            <li>
            <div class="p-4 bg-white rounded shadow"> 10¹⁰⁰  Various  The heat death of the universe is a scientific theory in which the universe will diminish to a state of no thermodynamic free energy and therefore will no longer be able to sustain directed motion or life. </div></li>
